I am looking to start a career in Web Development and so am actively looking out for a Web Development internship/ entry-level role. I am currently pursuing a number of online courses from various online platforms and am currently building my online portfolio. This is one of the most important courses I am taking currently and one of the most crucial skill sets that I need to build to land an internship/ job. And, thus I need a course completion certificate to showcase the skillset I have gained through this course to a potential recruiter.
This course also has quite detailed and practical assignments which will give me hands-on exposure to the exact skill set that I need to gain. There are very few online hands-on practical courses out there and this is one of them and so I do not want to miss out on learning from this one.
Moreover, there are peer-reviewed assignments in every single module of the course which will give me varied perspectives of approaching the same problem and expand my learning horizon. Also, peers reviewing my approach will help me track my progress in what aspects of the skillset I need to focus on and what concepts I need to put more work on.
All in all, this course is a great learning opportunity for me and will help me in getting my best foot forward and open doors for me in the Web Development industry by landing my first Web Development role.

I am a Computer Engineering graduate and am learning Web Development from online portals like Coursera and other open-source 
portals. I have found this course and its content to be quite useful. Also, I am looking for a job in the Web Development 
domain and so getting a certificate for this course would be quite helpful in showcasing the skills I have gained to a 
future potential recruiter.
My current financial condition, I wouldnâ€™t be able to pay for the same. I am currently not employed and still 
in the process of building skills in the field to land a job. Thus, it will be difficult for me to pay for the course. Also, 
currently, my father is the sole breadwinner in the family right now and is already burdened by the household expenses. 
Thus, it is very difficult for my family right now to pay for this course.
Hence, considering the current financial situation of my family, I request you to please grant me financial aid for this 
course, since this course would really help me in starting my career in Web Development.
